```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## do something simple: Z-score

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

I want a function to compute z-score

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

Try my function on some other things.

```{r}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("wechat")
z_scores(mtcars)
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```
